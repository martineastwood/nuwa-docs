# Examples

Welcome to the Nuwa examples section. This collection of projects demonstrates how to use the Nuwa toolchain to build Python extensions with Nim.

## Available Examples

- **[Featuristic](featuristic/)** - Feature engineering tools for machine learning, built with Nim
- **[Nuwa Example](nuwa-example/)** - Basic examples demonstrating Nuwa Build fundamentals

## Getting Started

Each example is a complete, working project. To explore them:

1. **Clone the example repository** or navigate to its source
2. **Install dependencies** - Usually just `nimble install nimpy`
3. **Build with Nuwa** - Run `nuwa develop` for development
4. **Run the code** - Each example includes test files or demonstration scripts

## Contributing Examples

Have you built something cool with Nuwa? We'd love to add it to the examples collection!

Good example projects:
- Show real-world use cases
- Include clear documentation
- Have working tests
- Demonstrate specific Nim/Python interop patterns

Feel free to submit a PR or open an issue to share your project.
